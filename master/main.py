"""Script to set up and run central server.

    Responsible for communication with computing nodes, primary backup, job
    scheduling, load balancing, job-node matchmaking decisions etc.

    Messages received from the node:
        - JOB_SUBMIT: The node sends the job to be submitted for execution
            in this message along with the executable file. The server tries to
            schedule the job if possible, else adds it to the job queue.

        - EXECUTED_JOB: This message tells the server that the job given to the
            node has either been completed or preempted(with the help of a
            completed flag). If the job has been completed, the server removes
            it from the job_queue and informs the node which has submitted the
            job. Also, it tries to schedule the jobs in the job queue. On the
            other hand, if the job is a preempted one, the server tries to
            schedule it again.

        - ACK_SUBMITTED_JOB_COMPLETION: The server ignores this.

        - ACK_JOB_EXEC: The server ignores this.

        - ACK_JOB_EXEC_PREEMPT: The server ignores this.

    Messages sent to node:
        - ACK_JOB_SUBMIT: Server sends this message on receiving a JOB_SUBMIT
            message from the node. Includes job's submission id in
            message's content field.

        - ACK_EXECUTED_JOB: Sent in response to EXECUTED_JOB message.

        - JOB_EXEC: Sent by server requesting execution of a job on the node.
            Has job object in content, and executable in file field.

        - JOB_PREEMPT_EXEC: Sent by server requesting preemption of an executing
            job, and execution of a new job. Has (new_job,
            job_to_preempt receipt id) in content, and executable file of new
            job in file.

        - SUBMITTED_JOB_COMPLETION: Server, on receiving EXECUTED_JOB message
            from a node, checks job's 'completed' attribute, and if True,
            sends SUBMITTED_JOB_COMPLETION to submitting node.
